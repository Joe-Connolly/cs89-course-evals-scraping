# cs89-course-evals-scraping
This repository contains two Python scripts that were used in preparation of Dartmouth College course review data for ingestion into IBM Waston Discovery and IBM Watson Knowledge Studio.

cs89-course-evals is a project where a team of three Dartmouth students developed a webapp to allow students to view summary insights on Dartmouth's courses, to enable students to make better informed decisions when picking classes and professors.  For example, students can use the cs89-course-evals webapp to see what percentage of student reviews were of a positive sentiment for a class. The project was prepared for Dartmouth's CS89: Cognitive Computing with Watson.
